/**
 * Whether math or coding, grouping symbols are vital to making sense of logic.  Misusing
 * grouping symbols can be confusing and lead to errors.  To ensure proper grouping, this 
 * module tests to see that they are properly used in a String.  This logic checks the included
 * grouping symbols, () {} [], against several rules:
 *   1. they must always be matched, with the starting coming before the ending
 *   2. they can be nested (i.e., [{}] with {} nested inside of [] and this example nested inside of ())
 *   3. The nesting cannot overlap (i.e., each nested grouping must complete before the outer grouping completes
 *
